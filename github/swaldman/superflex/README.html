  <p>You will find this library almost unusable, although I find I still use it all the time.</p> 
  <p>It is a library for importing collections of textfiles into a (postgres) database table, "designed" to be extensible for almost any conceivable format of large datasets often split (horizontally or vertically) into multiple files.</p> 
  <p>"Designed" goes in quotes. This was my very first significant Scala project, written in 2009 (built originally in Scala 2.7). It's a bit horrible, a complicated customize-by-inheritance-based API, full of ad-hoc features I added as some ever more exotic dataset had to be incorporated into the little data warehouse I built. It did its job well, but it's almost entirely undocumented and I am forever trying to remember how things worked and what it can and can't do.</p> 
  <p>I should rewrite it sanely. Or at the very least, document it. Someday.</p> 
  <p>If by some chance you are not me and you find the courage and the means to use this library, let me know!</p>
