            "title":"Relax NPM dependency version conflict resolution",
            "bodyText":"Current implementation requires that for each NPM package all version descriptors match exactly (for example, 15.4.2 and ~15.4.2 don't match). So any such \"conflict\" must be resolved explicitly via npmResolutions. This is not a big problem at the moment, but is likely to become more of an issue as the number of libraries using the bundler grows.\nThere are two ways to deal with this I can think of:\n\nAutomatic resolution for such conflicts within the plugin itself. This would, however, require adding and maintaining conflict resolution code compatible with package.json specification.\nA much simpler solution would be to delegate such resolution to npm/yarn themselves. package.json supports passing multiple version descriptors, which should be perfect for this purpose.",
