  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p> 
  <p>This project is an experiment in managing the akka-persistence journal as a stream. GridGain was selected as the basis for this experiment because it offers streaming and an in-memory data fabric with indexing and query support. The goal of the project is to demonstrate that streaming the journal opens up the possibility of generating <em>real-time projections of application state</em> and additionally, allows for the application of <em>complex event processing</em> at an application wide level.</p> 
  <p>The current state of this project is a minimum-viable-journal implementation that passes <a href="https://github.com/krasserm/akka-persistence-testkit" target="_blank">Martin Krasser's akka-persistence-testkit</a>. (I did not use the the akka experimental tck since it tests deprecated methods which I did not implement. This really needs to be fixed.)</p> 
  <p><strong>Plans</strong></p> 
  <p>There is still a lot of work to do with the journal to see if the ideas it is testing will work. In a rough semblance of priority order, the roadmap is:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Determine <em>durability</em> strategy (file system?, etc?)</li> 
   <li>Move <em>index storage</em> to GridGain cache</li> 
   <li>Accomodate <em>deployment</em> scenarios</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Adding to your project</strong></p> 
  <p>Feel free to experiment with the code if you like. It is still a very rough work-in-progress. You could even use it in production if you are extremely daring, but I would not recommend it.</p>
