  "description":"Extend Elasticsearch to support encryption-at-rest with per-tenant keys.  Encryption is implemented at the Lucene level, within the Lucene Directory interface, as well as within the ES translog.  This means that encryption is done transparently and no special filesystem configuration is required. Key fetching is abstracted and the developer is required to provide an implementation of it.",
