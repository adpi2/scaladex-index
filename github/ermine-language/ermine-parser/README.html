  <p>A parser combinator library for Scala, based on the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/trifecta" target="_blank">Trifecta library for Haskell</a>.</p> 
  <p>The main features of Trifecta is that it provides good error messages. When a parser fails, it can report the failure location in the source, along with a message indicating what the failure was, including suggestions for how the source could be modified to fix the error.</p> 
  <p>It is reasonably fast, and stack safe.</p>
