  <p>#MRSC</p> 
  <p>MRSC is a toolkit for rapid design and prototyping of (multi-result) supercompilers. MRSC 1.0 provides generic data structures and operations for building supercompilers based on the concept of <em>graph of configurations</em>. A supercompiler is encoded as a set of graph rewrite rules.</p>

  <p>The theory behind MRSC is described in the following papers:</p>

  </ul> 
  <p>##Code structure</p> 
  <p>MRSC is divided in a number of packages:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><code>mrsc.core</code> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Generic data structures (<code>SGraph</code> and <code>TGraph</code>) for representing a graph of configurations and operations on them.</li> 
     <li>An abstraction <code>GraphRewriteRules</code> for encoding the logic of supercompilation in terms of rewriting rules.</li> 
     <li>The component <code>GraphGenerator</code> for incremental producing <em>all</em> possible graphs of configurations for a given set of rewriting rules.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><code>mrsc.counters</code> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Example of a very simple (but non-trivial!) supercompiler for counter systems (see below).</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>##Example: generating proofs of safety of cache-coherence protocols</p> 
  <p>The entry point to this example is <code>mrsc/counters/demo.scala</code> (just launch it to see results in the console).</p> 
  <p>The package <code>mrsc.counters</code> contains an example of building a traditional (single-result) supercompiler and a (novel) multi-result supercompiler for counter systems. This example is inspired by works by Andrei Nemytykh, Alexei Lisitsa and Andrei Klimov:</p>

  <p>The works [1, 2, 4, 5] use the following approach for verification of protocols: express a protocol and its safety property as a Java of Refal program, supercompile a boolean expression stating the safety property of protocol - from the structure of supercompiled expression it will follow the safety of protocol. Following [3], we created a tiny language (of configurations) for encoding states of protocols (<code>mrsc/counters/language.scala</code>). Then protocols are expressed in Scala directly - as a DSL over the language of configurations (<code>mrsc/counters/protocols.scala</code>). There are two supercompilers in <code>mrsc/counters/rules.scala</code> encoded as graph rewrite rules - traditional single-result one and multi-result one. These supercompilers build graphs of configurations for a given protocol. Using a graph of configurations, we are able to produce a proof of safety of a protocol for a proof assistant <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/" target="_blank">Isabelle</a> (<code>mrsc/counters/proof.scala</code>). Demo application in <code>mrsc/counters/demo.scala</code> puts all things together: for a number of protocols traditional supercompiler is launched (as in [3]), multi-result supercompiler is launched and the smallest graphs is then selected from a set of graphs generated by multi-result supercompiler. The smallest graph is then residuated into a proof for Isabelle. More details are in an upcoming paper. The output of demo is shown in <a href="https://github.com/ilya-klyuchnikov/mrsc/blob/master/proofs.md" target="_blank">proofs.md</a>.</p> 
  <p>##Tests and examples</p> 
  <p>By default, tests and samples output is note verbose (to prevent a garbage in output). However, if you really want to see all details:</p> 
  <pre><code>&gt; project mrsc
&gt; set javaOptions += "-Dmrsc.verbose=true"
&gt; test-only mrsc.pfp.test.TicksEvaluationSuite
