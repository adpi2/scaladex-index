  <p>This is an RDD based implementation of word2phrase algorithm explained in "Section 4. Learning Phrases" of the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf" target="_blank">Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</a></p> 
  <p>There is already a Spark based <a href="https://github.com/s4weng/word2phrase" target="_blank">implementation</a>, but it did not fit our needs.</p>

  <p>This can also be applied to a specific column of a Spark dataframe</p> 
  <pre><code>import sqlc.implicits._
val phrases = WordToPhrase(rdd.toDF("words"), "words", cmsParams, scoreParams, token)

WordToPhrase(rdd.toDF("words"), "words", cmsParams, scoreParams, token, 2, StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY).collect().foreach(println)
</code></pre> 
  <p>The printed output would look something like this:</p> 
  <pre><code>[winter_is_coming and when the long night falls only the nights watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north]
[what will this place be like in the winter]
[and winter_is_coming]
[he could feel the eyes of the dead they were all listening he knew and winter was coming]
[the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have]
[because winter_is_coming]
[winter_is_coming arya whispered]
[fear is for the winter my little lord when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north]
[you are a young man tyrion mormont said how many winters have you seen]
[he could almost hear him and their lord father as well winter_is_coming and you are almost a man grown bran you have a duty]
