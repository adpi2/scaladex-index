  <p>#pirate pirate parses arrrrguments.</p> 
  <p>##Idea The idea behind pirate is that option parsing for command line tools should<br> be easier. The best mechanism that I've seen so far for command line tool<br> option parsing has been a builder python pattern (I forget what it's called)<br> and it seemed like a pain in the ass even with it as simple as it was. What<br> I wanted was to be able to just give a program the help text and for it to<br> figure out how to parse the arguments. The format should be:</p>

  <p>##Help Text Help text comes in several different flavors. There are flags, values, and strings.</p> 
  <p>###Flags A flag looks like this: "-f". Flags can be put together, like "-fad". These flags<br> mean that you expect a boolean value, whether the argument "-f" or any one or more<br> of the arguments in "-fad" are passed to you.</p> 
  <p>###Values A value looks like this: "-v type" where type is the datatype you expect to have passed in.<br> An example might be, "-n int" or "-D double". The different types that are supported are<br> int, double, and string.</p> 
  <p>###Strings There are also named strings, which is especially useful for filenames. A string can be<br> named anything except for the reserved keywords int, string, and double, and may look like<br> "input".</p> 
  <p>###Options You may not want to pass in flags all of the time, so there is the option to not pass in flags.<br> This is denoted with square brackets. These can wrap anything, and always mean that passing them<br> in is optional.</p> 
  <p>##Arguments Should be an array of Strings of flags, no square brackets, started by a hyphen.<br> Example: " -faddd " (whitespace is fine, except in the flags).</p> 
  <p>###Flags At least one flag must be passed in for a group of flags to be considered covered. Multiple<br> flags can be passed in either by repeating them, or by passing multiple flags back together.<br> An example of that would be for " -acdf ", you can turn on both a and d by passing back either</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>"-a -d"</li> 
   <li>"-ad" which are both considered valid.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>###Optional Arguments However, if you have one thing inside of the square brackets, you are<br> expected to match everything. For example, if you have "[ -ab -cd ]", valid strings to<br> pass in would be "-a -c", "-ab -d", "-dc -ba", "-d -d -b -a" and "". However, "-ab"<br> would NOT be valid, because you don't include any of the flags from "-cd".</p> 
  <p>###Order Flags can be passed in any order, and multiple times. All times will be considered valid. Values<br> can only be passed in once, but they are also in any order. However, they can only be passed<br> in any order within their "context". For example, in "[ -a [ -c -d ]]", valid arguments are all<br> strings where:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The empty string is passed in.</li> 
   <li>Only the -a argument is passed in.</li> 
   <li>Both the -a and the -c and -d arguments are passed in, where -c and -d are always next to each other.<br> An example of the simplest invalid string with all of the right flags, just in the wrong order, is<br> "-c -a -d".</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>##TODO I have been following the suggestions on how to handle arguments from <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch10s05.html" target="_blank">The Art of Unix Programming</a>.</p> 
  <p>The UNIX style of parsing arguments is basically completely implemented, with only small adjustments<br> that might be desirable, such as adding the option of specifying which values are mutually exclusive,<br> although since there isn't a preexisting way of showing that in help text, it isn't a high priority.</p> 
  <p>However, GNU style arguments haven't been implemented at all. If there is interest, I don't think they<br> will be very hard to do, but I personally prefer UNIX style, so if no one else is using this, I won't<br> bother. If you would like the functionality, feel free to file a github issue on me or email me about it.</p>
